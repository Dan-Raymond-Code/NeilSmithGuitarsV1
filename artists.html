                            <p>
                            Late great guitarist Tom Marth kindled his musical career by reigning as banjo champ back in his home state of Wisconsin. After his move to Las Vegas in the 1970s he worked thousands of gigs in that era's thriving lounge and pit band scene. Tom backed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Jones_(singer)" target="_blank">Jack Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.peggylee.com/" target="_blank">Peggy Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/jazzprofiles/archive/torme.html" target="_blank">Mel Torm&eacute;</a>, <a href="http://www.sammydavis-jr.com/" target="_blank">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a> and many other headliners. He studied orchestration and moonlighted as an in-demand arranger. More recently Tom became the guitarist and bassist for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scintas" target="_blank">The Scintas</a>. Neil Smith Guitars built him a special Landmark model.

                            <p>Steve Crenshaw Hidalgo was born in Burlingame, California. At the age of 5 he started playing guitar, something he quickly developed a passion for. When he was 13 Steve discovered the music of <a href="https://www.srvofficial.com/" target="_blank">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a> and continued his adolescence by immersing himself in everything blues-related. In 1991 he left the Bay Area to pursue a music career in Denver, Colorado. He continues to perform blues and rock gigs in Colorado where he wields his explosive blues and rock chops.</p>
